## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Being my first Junior level challenge, the JavaScript portion was particularly tricky at first. As I progressed further I am now more comfortable in writing functions and calling them when necessary. 

### Continued development

I didnt write many comments in this project, but I want to start writing them for future projects as I would sometimes get lost in the CSS code and didnt reallu know what certain code was doing what.

As I get better with JavaScript, I want to know what are the best methods and practices so I can apply them to my own code.
